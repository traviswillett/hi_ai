![A person looking up at the night sky, wondering about satellites.](assets/look_up.png)

Walk outside and look up at the night sky. How many of those dots are satellites? How many satellites are overhead that we can't see? How might we find out?

**Ways to investigate:**

- Count the dots that move across the sky
    - LEO and MEO satellites move faster than stars, this might work.
    - GEO satellites are so far away and move at the same speed as Earth's rotation so we can't see them... Next.
- Use a telescope or binoculars to see which dots look different
    - That's a lot of dots...
- Wait, we're AI experts, let's just ask an AI like Google Gemini or Copilot: "How can I tell which dots in the sky are satellites?"

**Try this:**

1. Open your web browser and go to <a href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Gemini</a>.
2. Type or say: `How many satellites are overhead of me right now?`
3. Read the answer and think about what you learn!

    > "That's a great question, but I can't give you a precise number without knowing your exact location and the specific definition of 'overhead.'
    >
    > The actual number of cataloged space objectsâ€”satellites, rocket bodies, and debrisâ€”crossing the visible sky at any given moment is always changing, but it's typically dozens of objects.
    >
    > According to real-time satellite trackers:
    >
    > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any given time, there can be dozens of objects (sometimes 80 or more) crossing the sky above a general location.
    >
    > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes operational satellites like those in the GPS, Starlink, or Iridium constellations, as well as defunct satellites and debris.
    >
    > If you are interested in seeing a specific, visible satellite, like the International Space Station (ISS) or a Starlink train, you would need to use a real-time satellite tracking website or app. These tools use your location to calculate the exact timing, path, and brightness for objects that will be visible to you."

# AI-enabled Satellite Tracker Project

**Goal:** Answer the question: _"How many satellites are overhead right now?"_ using code, visuals, and interactive tools.

**Tools:**
   - GitHub Copilot (AI coding assistant)
   - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
   - Python
   - Docker
   - MagicPatterns (AI Visualization Mockup)
   - JavaScript & CesiumJS (for 3D visualization)

## Next Steps

- Sample code and AI prompts will be added in each folder as you progress.
- Visuals and diagrams will be included to guide each step.
- No prior coding experience neededâ€”just curiosity!


**Letâ€™s build something amazingâ€”one visual step at a time!**

## Get Set Up: Tools Youâ€™ll Need

Before you start coding, make sure you have everything you need!

### 1. Create a GitHub Account
1. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
2. Click **Sign up** and follow the instructions to create your free account.
3. Verify your email address.

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install VS Code for your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
3. Open VS Code after installation.


### 3. Enable GitHub Copilot
1. In VS Code, click the Extensions icon (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
2. Search for **GitHub Copilot**.
3. Click **Install** next to the GitHub Copilot extension.
4. Sign in with your GitHub account if prompted.
5. Youâ€™re ready to use AI to help you code!

### 4. Install Python
1. You need to have Python installed on your computer to run Python files.
2. If you donâ€™t have Python yet, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.
3. After installing, restart VS Code.
4. When you open a `.py` file in VS Code, you may see a prompt to install the Python extensionâ€”click **Install** if prompted.
5. You can check if Python is installed by opening a terminal in VS Code and typing `python --version` (or `python3 --version` on Mac/Linux).
6. If you have any issues, see the [VS Code Python setup guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).

## Make Sure Everything Works: Hello World Test

Before you start with satellites, letâ€™s make sure your setup is working!

1. Open this project folder in VS Code.
2. Create a new file called `hello.py`.
3. In the new file, type `# Write a Python program that prints Hello, world!` and press `Enter`.
4. If you have GitHub Copilot enabled, you should see a suggestion for a print statement. Press `Tab` to accept it.
5. Save the file and run it (right-click and select **Run Python File in Terminal**, or type `python hello.py` in the terminal).
6. You should see `Hello, world!` printed in the terminal.

If this works, youâ€™re ready to start coding with Copilot!

Let's Go!
